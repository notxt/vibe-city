## Critical Issues Found by Tests

### 🚨 **Resource Management System Bug**
- **Issue**: Buildings place visually but don't update resources
- **Impact**: Core gameplay broken - no economic consequences
- **Tests Affected**: All building placement tests
- **Fix Needed**: Debug game.ts resource calculation logic

### 📊 **Test Coverage Summary**
- **Total Requirements**: 21 identified  
- **Tested**: 16 (76%)
- **Passing**: 9 (43%)
- **Bug Revealed**: 7 (33%)
- **Not Implemented**: 5 (24%)

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Resource Management Bug** - Priority: Critical
   - Debug money deduction logic
   - Fix population/power calculation
   - Re-run all affected tests

2. **Expand Test Coverage**
   - Add edge case tests (insufficient funds, etc.)
   - Add performance tests for large grids
   - Add accessibility tests

3. **Implement Planned Features**
   - Add tests for new features as they're developed
   - Maintain traceability matrix updates
