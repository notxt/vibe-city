# Vibe City - Game Specification

## Overview
Vibe City is a browser-based city builder game built using only web standards (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). Players manage resources, construct buildings, and grow their city on a grid-based map.

## Core Game Mechanics

### Grid System
- **Size**: 20x15 tile grid (expandable in future versions)
- **Tile Types**: Each tile can contain one building or remain empty
- **Placement Rules**: Buildings can only be placed on empty tiles
- **Demolition**: Any building can be demolished for 50% cost refund

### Resource Management
- **Money**: Primary currency for purchasing buildings and upgrades
- **Population**: Generated by residential buildings, required by commercial/service buildings
- **Power**: Generated by power plants, required by most buildings
- **Happiness** (planned): Affects population growth and tax revenue

### Building System
Buildings are the core gameplay element with the following properties:
- **Cost**: One-time purchase price
- **Maintenance**: Ongoing upkeep cost (planned)
- **Requirements**: Resources needed to function
- **Output**: Resources generated per game cycle
- **Size**: Currently 1x1, expandable to larger buildings

## Progression System

### City Growth Phases
1. **Settlement** (0-100 population): Basic survival, establishing infrastructure
2. **Town** (100-500 population): Expanding services, economic growth
3. **City** (500-2000 population): Advanced buildings, specialization
4. **Metropolis** (2000+ population): Mega-projects, optimization

### Unlock System
- **Building Unlocks**: New buildings available at population milestones
- **Feature Unlocks**: Advanced mechanics unlock with city growth
- **Challenge Modes**: Different scenarios and difficulty levels

### Victory Conditions
- **Population Goal**: Reach specific population targets
- **Economic Goal**: Achieve certain income levels
- **Efficiency Goal**: Maintain happiness/satisfaction ratios
- **Sandbox Mode**: No specific victory, creative building

## User Interface
